Description: Methods for comparing two alternative multiple 
    sequence alignments (MSAs) to determine whether they align homologous residues in 
    the same columns as one another. It then classifies similarities and differences 
    into conserved gaps, conserved sequence, merges, splits or shifts of one MSA relative 
    to the other. Summarising these categories for each MSA column yields information 
    on which sequence regions are agreed upon my both MSAs, and which differ. Several 
    plotting functions enable easily visualisation of the comparison data for analysis.
